## Getting Started

### Install the Component

The Dashing Framework is delivered as a [bower](bower.io) component.

1. Install bower
  ```grunt
  npm install -g bower
  ```

  >Note: Bower requires node, npm and git.

2. Install the dashing bower component
  ```grunt
  bower install dashing --save
  ```

### Working with SASS

1. Include Normalize
  Include normalize first in your main application Sass file. We provide a version of normalize that we keep updated, or you may include normalize directly.
  ```scss
  @import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/vendor/normalize";
  ```
  > Note: You could optionally use the normalize project directly

2. Include Base
  Base files include variables, mixins, extendables, utilities and the dashing color scale.
  ```scss
  @import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/base/base";
  ```

3. Optional â€“ Include an overrides file to customize the default variables
  ```scss
  @import "overrides";
  ```
  > Note: This is a custom file that you will need to create and include from your styles directory.

4. Include Modules
  ```scss
  @import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/modules/modules";
  ```


### Working with CSS

Include a link to the dashing.css stylesheet in your `index.html` file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/bower_components/dashing/dashing.css">
```

## Development

### Clone the repository with git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashframework/dashing.git
```

### Releasing a new version

1. Build the Sass and compress the CSS
  ```bash
  sass --watch dashing.scss:dashing.css --style compressed
  ```

2. Check the previously tagged versions
  ```bash
  git tag
  ```

3. Update the version number in the `bower.json` file (See [here](http://semver.org/) for versioning conventions)

4. Update the Dashing Version number found on line 4 of the README.md

5. Commit the changes made in the previous steps
  ```bash
  git commit -m "[message]"
  ```

6. Tag the commit with the appropriate version number
  ```bash
  git tag vX.Y.Z
  ```

7. Push your committed changes
  ```bash
  git push
  ```

8. Push your new tag
  ```bash
  git push --tags
  ```
